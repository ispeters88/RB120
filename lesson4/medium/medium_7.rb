# How could you change the method name below so that the method name is more clear and less repetitive?

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def light_status
    "I have a brightness level of #{brightness} and a color of #{color}"
  end

end

# We could simplify it to `#status`:

class Light
  attr_accessor :brightness, :color

  def initialize(brightness, color)
    @brightness = brightness
    @color = color
  end

  def status
    "I have a brightness level of #{brightness} and a color of #{color}"
  end
end

# This way, if we were to create an instance `light`:

light = Light.new('high', 'natural')

# we would be able to write

p light.status

# instead of `light.light_status`
